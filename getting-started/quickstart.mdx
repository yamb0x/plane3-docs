This guide walks you through creating your first 3D model on plane3. By the end, you will have an AI-generated model on your canvas that you can manipulate, retexture, and export.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up">
    Go to [placeholder.plane3.com](https://placeholder.plane3.com) and create an account. You can sign up with Google, GitHub, or email.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a project and board">
    After signing in, you land on your dashboard. Click **New project** to create one, then click into it. Every project starts with a default board. You can rename it or create additional boards from the board switcher in the top bar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the generate menu">
    Double-click anywhere on the canvas to open the generate menu. This is where you start all AI generation -- both text-to-3D and image-to-3D.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter a prompt and generate">
    Type a description of the model you want to create. For example:

    ```
    a low-poly treasure chest
    ```

    Select an AI service from the dropdown if you want a specific one, or leave the default. Click **Generate** to start.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for your model">
    Generation typically takes 60 to 90 seconds depending on the AI service and current load. A progress indicator appears on the canvas while your model is being created.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Interact with your model">
    Once the model appears on the canvas, you can:

    - **Click** it to select and see its properties in the right panel
    - **Drag** it to reposition on the canvas
    - **Right-click** it to open the context menu with additional actions

    The context menu gives you access to:

    - **Retexture** -- apply a new texture using AI
    - **Export** -- download as GLB, glTF, OBJ, or STL
    - **Duplicate** -- create a copy on the canvas
    - **Delete** -- remove from the board
  </Step>
</Steps>
