Team management is available on the [Team plan](/account/plans-and-billing). It lets you invite people to your team, control what they can do, and collaborate in real time on shared boards.

## Inviting members

To invite someone to your team:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open team settings">
    Go to your account settings and select the **Team** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter their email">
    Type the email address of the person you want to invite and select a role for them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the invitation">
    Click **Send invite**. The invitee receives an email with a link to join your team. The invitation expires after 7 days.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Pending invitations appear in the team settings panel. You can resend or revoke an invitation before it is accepted.

## Roles

Every team member is assigned one of three roles. Roles determine what actions a member can take.

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control over the team, billing, and all content. Can manage members, transfer ownership, and delete the team. |
| **Editor** | Can create, edit, and delete projects, boards, and objects. Cannot manage team members or billing. |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access. Can view boards and objects but cannot create, edit, or delete anything. |

## Permissions

The table below shows what each role can do.

| Action | Owner | Editor | Viewer |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| View boards and objects | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Create projects and boards | Yes | Yes | No |
| Generate 3D models | Yes | Yes | No |
| Edit and move objects | Yes | Yes | No |
| Add annotations | Yes | Yes | No |
| Export models | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Import files | Yes | Yes | No |
| Delete projects and boards | Yes | Yes | No |
| Invite and remove members | Yes | No | No |
| Change member roles | Yes | No | No |
| Manage billing | Yes | No | No |
| Transfer ownership | Yes | No | No |
| Delete the team | Yes | No | No |

## Transferring ownership

Only the current Owner can transfer ownership. To transfer:

1. Go to **Team settings**
2. Find the member you want to promote
3. Click the role dropdown and select **Owner**
4. Confirm the transfer

<Warning>
Transferring ownership demotes you to Editor. This action cannot be undone without the new Owner transferring ownership back to you.
</Warning>

## Removing members

To remove a member from the team:

1. Go to **Team settings**
2. Find the member you want to remove
3. Click **Remove** and confirm

Removed members immediately lose access to all team boards and projects. Any objects they created remain on the boards. The Owner cannot be removed -- ownership must be transferred first.
