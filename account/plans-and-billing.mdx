## Free

The Free plan gives you access to the core plane3 experience. You get one project with up to three boards and 50 AI generations per month. This is a good starting point for exploring plane3 and working on individual projects.

## Pro

The Pro plan removes project and board limits and increases your AI generation quota to 500 per month. You also get 50 GB of storage and access to the path tracer for photorealistic rendering.

Pro is suited for individual creators who generate 3D content regularly and need higher-quality rendering output.

## Team

The Team plan includes everything in Pro plus real-time collaboration, team management, and priority support. Each team member gets their own allocation of 500 AI generations per month, and the team shares 200 GB of storage.

Team is designed for groups that need to work together on the same boards simultaneously. See [Team management](/account/team-management) for details on inviting members and managing roles.

## Upgrading your plan

To upgrade:

1. Open your account settings from the top-right menu
2. Go to the **Billing** section
3. Select the plan you want
4. Enter your payment details and confirm

Plan changes take effect immediately. If you upgrade mid-cycle, you are charged a prorated amount for the remainder of the billing period.

## Cancellation

You can cancel your subscription at any time. When you cancel:

- Your plan remains active until the end of the current billing period
- After the billing period ends, your account reverts to the Free plan
- Projects and boards beyond the Free plan limits become read-only until you reduce them or re-subscribe
