title: "What is plane3?"
description: "An overview of plane3, the collaborative 3D workspace for teams that create, manage, and iterate on 3D content together."
---

plane3 is a browser-based collaborative 3D workspace where teams create, manage, explore, and iterate on 3D assets together. You work on an infinite isometric canvas with real-time collaboration, AI-powered 3D generation, and a visual node graph for building repeatable pipelines -- all without installing anything.

## Who it's for

- **3D artists** who want to generate, retexture, and refine models without switching between tools
- **Game designers** building asset libraries and iterating on props, characters, and environments
- **Product designers** visualizing physical products in 3D with photorealistic rendering
- **Creative teams** that need a shared space to review, annotate, and approve 3D content together

## Two-tier interaction model

plane3 gives you two ways to work, depending on what you need.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Board level" icon="hand-pointer">
    The default experience. You interact directly with 3D objects on the canvas -- move them, generate new ones, add annotations, and export. No technical setup required.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Node graph level" icon="diagram-project">
    Switch to the graph view to build visual pipelines that chain AI generation, texturing, mesh operations, and more. Each node represents a discrete operation, and connections define the data flow between them.
  </Card>
</Columns>

You can switch between these views at any time using the view toggle in the top bar.

## Core capabilities

## How plane3 differs from traditional 3D tools

| | Traditional 3D tools | plane3 |
|---|---|---|
| **Installation** | Desktop software, large downloads | Browser-based, nothing to install |
| **Collaboration** | File sharing, version conflicts | Real-time multiplayer with live cursors |
| **AI generation** | Separate tools and workflows | Built-in text-to-3D and image-to-3D |
| **Learning curve** | Complex interfaces with deep menus | Two-tier model: simple board for basic tasks, node graph for advanced work |
| **Pipeline building** | Script-based automation | Visual node graph with drag-and-drop connections |
