This tutorial covers the workflow for creating 3D assets suitable for real-time game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot. You will generate a model, clean up its mesh, apply game-appropriate textures, and export in a format ready for your engine.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a base model">
    Start with either text-to-3D or image-to-3D generation:

    - **Text-to-3D** -- double-click the canvas, type a description like "stylized medieval shield with crest", and click **Generate**
    - **Image-to-3D** -- double-click the canvas, switch to Image to 3D, upload a concept art image, and click **Generate**

    Wait for the model to appear on the canvas (60 to 90 seconds).

    <Tip>
      For game assets, include style keywords in your prompt that match your game's art direction: "low-poly", "stylized", "hand-painted", or "PBR realistic".
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remesh for clean topology">
    AI-generated models often have irregular triangle meshes. Use Remesh to produce a cleaner mesh:

    1. Right-click the model and select **Remesh**
    2. Set a target polygon count appropriate for your use case (see the table below)
    3. Run the remesh operation

    <Note>
      Remeshing simplifies geometry while preserving the overall shape. Some fine details may be lost at lower polygon counts -- preview the result before continuing.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply game-appropriate textures">
    Use Retexture to generate materials that fit your game's art style:

    1. Right-click the model and select **Retexture**
    2. Enter a prompt describing the surface style (for example, "hand-painted fantasy style" or "PBR metal with scratches and wear")
    3. Wait for the retexture to complete

    Review the result by rotating the model with `Q` and `E` to check all sides.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check quality in the path tracer">
    Before exporting, verify the model looks correct under different lighting:

    1. Right-click the model and select **Render**
    2. Orbit around the model in the path tracer viewport
    3. Check for texture seams, missing surfaces, or geometry artifacts

    This step is optional but helps catch issues before you import into your game engine.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export for your game engine">
    Right-click the model and select **Export**. Choose **GLB** as the format.

    GLB is supported by all major game engines:

    - **Unity** -- drag the GLB file into your Assets folder
    - **Unreal Engine** -- use the import dialog or drag into the Content Browser
    - **Godot** -- place the GLB file in your project directory and it auto-imports
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Polygon count guidelines

| Asset type | Target polygon count | Use case |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| Background prop | 500 - 2,000 | Objects the player rarely sees up close |
| Interactive prop | 2,000 - 10,000 | Items the player picks up or examines |
| Character | 10,000 - 30,000 | Player characters or important NPCs |
| Hero asset | 30,000 - 100,000 | Main focal points, cutscene models |

<Warning>
  These are general guidelines. Your target counts depend on your game's platform and performance budget. Mobile games typically need lower counts than PC or console titles.
</Warning>

## Texture considerations

- AI-generated textures are typically 1024x1024 or 2048x2048 pixels
- For mobile games, consider downscaling textures to 512x512 after export
- GLB exports include diffuse (albedo) textures embedded in the file
- If your engine requires separate texture maps (normal, roughness, metallic), you may need to extract and process them in your engine's material editor
