This tutorial walks you through the path tracer settings to produce a high-quality photorealistic render of a 3D model. You will set up the environment, configure the camera, and export the final image.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select your model">
    Click the model you want to render on the canvas. If you have multiple models on the board, make sure you select the specific one you want to focus on.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the path tracer">
    Right-click the selected model and choose **Render**. The path tracer opens with your model centered in a 3D viewport. The renderer begins accumulating samples immediately with default settings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose an HDRI environment">
    In the render settings panel, find the **Environment** section and select an HDRI preset:

    - **Outdoor** -- natural sunlight with sky. Good for architectural models, vehicles, and outdoor products.
    - **Studio** -- controlled, even lighting. Good for product shots, small objects, and clean presentations.
    - **Sunset** -- warm, low-angle lighting with golden tones. Good for organic models and dramatic presentations.

    The environment determines the overall lighting mood and what reflects in shiny surfaces.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust sun position">
    If you selected an outdoor or sunset environment, adjust the sun:

    - **Azimuth** -- controls the horizontal angle of the sun (the direction the light comes from)
    - **Elevation** -- controls how high the sun is above the horizon

    Lower elevations produce long, dramatic shadows. Higher elevations give even, overhead lighting.

    <Tip>
      For dramatic renders, set the elevation between 15 and 30 degrees. This creates long shadows and warm, golden light similar to golden hour photography.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable depth of field">
    In the **Camera** section of the render settings:

    1. Toggle **Depth of field** on
    2. Set the **f-stop** value to control the amount of background blur:
       - **f/1.4 - f/2.8** -- strong blur, only the focal point is sharp (good for close-up hero shots)
       - **f/4 - f/8** -- moderate blur, subject is sharp with a softly blurred background
       - **f/11 - f/22** -- minimal blur, most of the scene is in focus

    The focal point defaults to the center of your model. Adjust it if you want to focus on a specific part.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the quality preset">
    In the **Quality** section, select **Ultra**. This sets the renderer to accumulate 2048 samples, which produces a clean image with minimal noise.

    Available presets:

    | Preset | Samples | Best for |
    |--------|---------|----------|
    | Preview | 32 | Quick previews |
    | Medium | 128 | Checking composition and lighting |
    | High | 512 | Final renders for web use |
    | Ultra | 2048 | Hero images, print, portfolio work |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for convergence">
    The path tracer progressively refines the image. A **sample counter** in the viewport shows how many samples have been accumulated out of the target.

    Early samples appear noisy. As more samples accumulate, the image becomes smoother and more accurate. At Ultra quality, expect the render to take several minutes depending on scene complexity.

    <Note>
      You do not have to wait for full convergence. If the image looks clean enough at, say, 1200 out of 2048 samples, you can export early.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export the render">
    Click **Export** in the path tracer toolbar. The render is saved as a PNG file at the current viewport resolution.

    The exported image includes the alpha channel if the background is transparent, which is useful for compositing the render into other images or layouts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="The render looks too dark">
  Try switching to a brighter HDRI preset (Studio provides the most even lighting). You can also increase the sun elevation if using an outdoor environment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="There is too much noise even at high sample counts">
  Complex transparent or reflective materials take more samples to resolve. Try increasing the quality preset or wait for more samples to accumulate.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The depth of field blur looks wrong">
  Make sure the focal point is set correctly. If the wrong part of the model is in focus, adjust the focal distance in the camera settings.
</Accordion>
