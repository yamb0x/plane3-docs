---

This tutorial walks you through running a structured review session where your team provides feedback on 3D models using annotations and real-time collaboration.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the board with your models">
    Navigate to the project and board that contains the models you want to review. Make sure all the assets you want feedback on are placed on the canvas.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share the board with your team">
    Click the **Share** button in the top bar. You can:

    - **Copy the board link** and send it directly to team members
    - **Invite by email** to grant access to specific people

    Anyone with the link can join the board and see your models in real time.

    <Note>
      Share permissions depend on your plan. On the Free plan, shared boards are view-only by default. Pro and Team plans support edit access for collaborators.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Place sticky notes for feedback">
    Press `C` to switch to the sticky note tool, then click on the canvas near the object you want to comment on. Type your feedback directly into the note.

    Use sticky notes for:

    - Specific feedback on a model ("Texture seam visible on the left side")
    - Approval or rejection notes ("Approved for production")
    - Questions for the creator ("Is this the final topology?")

    Each sticky note shows the author name, so you can track who said what.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sketch markup for visual feedback">
    Press `P` to switch to the sketch tool. Draw directly on the canvas to circle problem areas, suggest shape changes, or indicate where modifications are needed.

    Sketches are visible to all collaborators in real time.

    <Tip>
      Combine sketches with sticky notes -- draw an arrow pointing to a problem area, then place a sticky note with the explanation.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use cursor chat for quick discussion">
    Press `/` to open cursor chat. Type a message and it appears next to your cursor on the canvas, visible to everyone on the board.

    Cursor chat is useful for:

    - Quick back-and-forth questions that do not need a permanent annotation
    - Coordinating who is reviewing which model
    - Real-time discussion while someone is making changes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export annotations and action items">
    After the review, you can capture the feedback:

    - **Screenshot** the board with annotations visible for documentation
    - **Copy sticky note text** to create action items in your project management tool
    - Keep the board as a living record -- annotations persist until you delete them
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Review session best practices

- **Prepare the board first** -- arrange models with enough spacing so annotations do not overlap
- **Assign areas** -- if reviewing many models, assign team members to specific sections of the canvas
- **Use consistent notation** -- agree on a color or labeling system for sticky notes (for example, red for blocking issues, yellow for suggestions)
- **Time-box the session** -- set a clear end time and focus on the most important items first
