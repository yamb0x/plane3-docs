title: "Create your first 3D model"
description: "An end-to-end tutorial that walks you through generating a 3D model, inspecting it, retexturing, and exporting."
---

This tutorial takes you from an empty board to a finished, exported 3D model. You will generate a model from a text prompt, learn how to navigate around it, improve its textures, and download the result.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a project and board">
    From your dashboard, click **New project** and give it a name. Open the project -- it starts with a default board. You can rename the board from the board switcher in the top bar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the generate menu">
    Double-click anywhere on the canvas to open the generate menu. Select **Text to 3D** if it is not already selected.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter a prompt">
    Type a description of what you want to generate. Be specific about shape, material, and style. For example:

    ```
    medieval treasure chest with iron bands
    ```

    <Tip>
      Good prompts include material details ("wooden", "metallic"), style cues ("low-poly", "stylized", "realistic"), and structural descriptors ("with rivets", "open lid"). Avoid vague terms like "cool" or "nice".
    </Tip>

    Select an AI service from the dropdown or leave the default, then click **Generate**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for generation">
    Generation takes roughly 60 to 90 seconds depending on the AI service and server load. A progress indicator appears on the canvas while the model is being created.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Inspect the model">
    Once the model appears, you can examine it from different angles:

    - **Rotate the camera** -- press `Q` to rotate 90 degrees left, `E` to rotate 90 degrees right
    - **Zoom** -- scroll up to zoom in, scroll down to zoom out
    - **Pan** -- middle-click and drag, or hold `Space` and drag

    Click the model to select it and see its properties in the right panel.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Retexture the model">
    If the initial textures are not what you want, you can regenerate them:

    1. Right-click the model to open the context menu
    2. Select **Retexture**
    3. Optionally enter a texture prompt to guide the style (for example, "weathered oak wood with dark iron fittings")
    4. Wait for the retexturing to complete

    <Tip>
      You can retexture multiple times. Each run replaces the previous texture, so experiment until you get the look you want.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export the model">
    When you are satisfied with the result:

    1. Right-click the model
    2. Select **Export**
    3. Choose **GLB** as the format (or glTF, OBJ, STL depending on your needs)
    4. The file downloads to your computer

    GLB is the most widely supported format and includes textures in a single file.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prompt writing tips

| Technique | Example | Why it helps |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Specify materials | "carved stone gargoyle" | Guides the texture generation toward the right surface look |
| Mention style | "low-poly cartoon sword" | Controls the geometric complexity and visual style |
| Describe structure | "open laptop with visible keyboard" | Gives the model clear geometric constraints |
| Add context | "sci-fi control panel with glowing buttons" | Helps the AI choose appropriate details and lighting cues |

<Note>
  Different AI services interpret prompts differently. If the result does not match your intent, try switching the service in the generate menu dropdown.
