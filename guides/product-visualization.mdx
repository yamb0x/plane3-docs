This tutorial walks you through creating a product visualization -- from importing your model to exporting a finished render suitable for marketing materials or e-commerce listings.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import your product model">
    Drag and drop your model file (GLB, OBJ, or FBX) onto the canvas. The model appears on the board after a short processing step.

    You can also use **File > Import** from the top menu to browse for files on your computer.

    <Note>
      GLB is recommended for import because it bundles geometry and textures in a single file. OBJ and FBX imports may require separate texture files.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Improve materials with retexture">
    If your model's textures need refinement or a different look:

    1. Right-click the model and select **Retexture**
    2. Enter a texture prompt that describes the surface finish you want (for example, "brushed aluminum with matte finish")
    3. Wait for retexturing to complete

    Skip this step if your imported model already has production-ready materials.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the path tracer">
    Right-click the model and select **Render**. The path tracer opens with your model centered in the viewport.

    The path tracer renders your model with physically accurate lighting, reflections, and shadows.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose the studio HDRI preset">
    In the render settings panel, find the **Environment** section and select the **Studio** HDRI preset. This provides even, neutral lighting that works well for product photography.

    <Tip>
      The Studio preset mimics a product photography lightbox. For outdoor products (furniture, vehicles), try the Outdoor preset instead for natural lighting with a visible sky.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust the camera">
    Set up your shot by adjusting camera settings in the render panel:

    - **Focal length** -- use 50mm to 85mm for a natural product photography look. Lower values (35mm) add slight perspective exaggeration; higher values (100mm+) flatten the image.
    - **Depth of field** -- enable this to blur the background and draw attention to the product. Start with a moderate f-stop (f/4 to f/8) and adjust.
    - **Position** -- orbit the camera around the model by dragging in the viewport to find the best angle.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set render quality">
    In the quality settings, choose **High** or **Ultra**:

    - **High** -- good balance of quality and render time, suitable for most product images
    - **Ultra** -- maximum quality with 2048 samples, best for hero images and print materials

    Higher quality settings take longer to converge but produce cleaner images with less noise.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for convergence and export">
    The path tracer progressively refines the image. Watch the sample counter in the viewport -- the image becomes cleaner as more samples accumulate.

    Once you are satisfied with the quality, click **Export** to save the render as a PNG file.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Lighting tips for product shots

| Product type | Recommended environment | Camera settings |
|-------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Small objects (jewelry, electronics) | Studio HDRI | 85mm focal length, shallow depth of field |
| Furniture | Outdoor or Studio HDRI | 50mm focal length, moderate depth of field |
| Apparel and accessories | Studio HDRI | 50mm focal length, full depth of field |
| Vehicles | Outdoor HDRI | 35mm focal length, moderate depth of field |

<Tip>
  For transparent or reflective products (glass bottles, chrome objects), the Studio HDRI preset provides clean reflections. You can adjust the HDRI rotation to control where highlights appear on the surface.
