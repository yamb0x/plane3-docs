description: "Overview of the plane3 REST API for managing projects, models, and generation jobs programmatically."
---

The plane3 API lets you manage projects, models, generation jobs, and renders programmatically. You can integrate plane3 into your existing tools and automate 3D content workflows.

## Base URL

All API requests use the following base URL:

```
https://placeholder.plane3.com/api/v1
```

## Format

The API is a standard REST API that accepts and returns JSON. All request bodies must be sent as JSON with the `Content-Type: application/json` header. Responses are JSON with a `Content-Type: application/json` header.

## Authentication

Every request requires authentication via an API key sent in the `Authorization` header. See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) for details on generating and using API keys.

## Quick example

List all projects in your account:

```bash
curl -X GET https://placeholder.plane3.com/api/v1/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "proj_abc123",
      "name": "My first project",
      "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "has_more": false
}
```
