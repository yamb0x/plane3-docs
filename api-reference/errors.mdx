---

The plane3 API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. Errors return a consistent JSON structure with a machine-readable code and a human-readable message.

## Error response format

All error responses follow this structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "The 'name' field is required."
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `error.code` | string | A machine-readable error identifier |
| `error.message` | string | A human-readable description of what went wrong |

## HTTP status codes

### Success codes

| Code | Meaning | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `200` | OK | The request succeeded |
| `201` | Created | A new resource was created |
| `204` | No Content | The request succeeded with no response body (used for deletes) |

### Client error codes

| Code | Meaning | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `400` | Bad Request | The request body is malformed or missing required fields |
| `401` | Unauthorized | The API key is missing, invalid, or expired |
| `403` | Forbidden | The API key does not have permission for this action |
| `404` | Not Found | The requested resource does not exist |
| `409` | Conflict | The resource already exists (for example, duplicate project name) |
| `422` | Unprocessable Entity | The request is well-formed but contains validation errors |
| `429` | Too Many Requests | You have exceeded the rate limit. See [Rate limits](/api-reference/rate-limits) |

### Server error codes

| Code | Meaning | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `500` | Internal Server Error | Something went wrong on the server. Retry the request or contact support if it persists |

## Common error examples

<Accordion title="401 Unauthorized -- missing or invalid API key">
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "unauthorized",
    "message": "Invalid or missing API key. Include a valid key in the Authorization header."
  }
}
```

Fix: check that your `Authorization` header is set to `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` and that the key has not been revoked.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="404 Not Found -- resource does not exist">
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "not_found",
    "message": "Project 'proj_xyz789' was not found."
  }
}
```

Fix: verify the resource ID is correct and that you have access to it.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="422 Unprocessable Entity -- validation error">
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "validation_error",
    "message": "The 'prompt' field must be between 1 and 2000 characters."
  }
}
```

Fix: check the request body against the endpoint's schema and correct the invalid field.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="429 Too Many Requests -- rate limited">
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "rate_limited",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Retry after 2025-01-15T10:30:45Z."
  }
}
```

Fix: wait until the time indicated in the `X-RateLimit-Reset` header before retrying. See [Rate limits](/api-reference/rate-limits) for details.
</Accordion>

## Best practices

- **Check the status code first** -- use the HTTP status code to determine the category of error before parsing the response body
- **Log the error code** -- include `error.code` in your application logs for debugging
- **Retry on 500 errors** -- server errors are usually transient. Retry with exponential backoff (wait 1s, then 2s, then 4s)
- **Do not retry on 4xx errors** -- client errors indicate a problem with the request that retrying will not fix
