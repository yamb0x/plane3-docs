description: "How to generate and use API keys to authenticate requests to the plane3 API."
---

The plane3 API uses API key authentication. Every request must include a valid API key in the `Authorization` header.

## Generate an API key

1. Open the plane3 app and go to **Settings > API keys**
2. Click **Create API key**
3. Give the key a descriptive name (for example, "CI pipeline" or "Data sync script")
4. Copy the key immediately -- it is only shown once

<Warning>
  Store your API key securely. Do not commit it to version control or expose it in client-side code. If a key is compromised, revoke it immediately from Settings and create a new one.
</Warning>

## Send authenticated requests

Include the API key in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` scheme:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Code examples

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl -X GET https://placeholder.plane3.com/api/v1/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://placeholder.plane3.com/api/v1/projects", {
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://placeholder.plane3.com/api/v1/projects",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"},
)

data = response.json()
print(data)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Key scoping

API keys are scoped to your user account. A key has the same permissions as the user who created it:

- Keys created by a project owner can read and write all resources in that project
- Keys created by a collaborator are limited to the permissions granted to that collaborator

## Key management

You can manage your API keys from **Settings > API keys**:

- **View active keys** -- see all keys with their names and creation dates
- **Revoke a key** -- click **Revoke** next to any key to immediately disable it
- **Rotate keys** -- create a new key, update your integrations, then revoke the old key

<Note>
  Revoking a key takes effect immediately. Any in-flight requests using the revoked key will fail with a `401 Unauthorized` error.
</Note>
