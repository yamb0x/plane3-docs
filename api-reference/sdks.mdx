plane3 provides official SDKs for JavaScript/TypeScript and Python. Both are open source and wrap the REST API with typed methods and built-in error handling.

## JavaScript / TypeScript

Install the SDK from npm:

```bash
npm install @plane3/sdk
```

Quick usage:

```typescript
import { Plane3Client } from "@plane3/sdk";

const client = new Plane3Client({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

// List all projects
const projects = await client.projects.list();
console.log(projects);

// Create a generation job
const generation = await client.generations.create({
  prompt: "a medieval treasure chest with iron bands",
  service: "hunyuan3d",
  project_id: "proj_abc123",
});
console.log(generation.id, generation.status);
```

- **Repository**: [github.com/plane3/sdk-js](https://placeholder.plane3.com/github/sdk-js)
- **npm package**: [@plane3/sdk](https://placeholder.plane3.com/npm/plane3-sdk)
- **TypeScript types**: Included. No separate `@types` package needed.

## Python

Install the SDK from PyPI:

```bash
pip install plane3
```

Quick usage:

```python
from plane3 import Plane3Client

client = Plane3Client(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# List all projects
projects = client.projects.list()
print(projects)

# Create a generation job
generation = client.generations.create(
    prompt="a medieval treasure chest with iron bands",
    service="hunyuan3d",
    project_id="proj_abc123",
)
print(generation.id, generation.status)
```

- **Repository**: [github.com/plane3/sdk-python](https://placeholder.plane3.com/github/sdk-python)
- **PyPI package**: [plane3](https://placeholder.plane3.com/pypi/plane3)
- **Python versions**: 3.9 and above

## SDK features

Both SDKs provide:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Typed methods | Every endpoint has a corresponding method with typed parameters and return values |
| Error handling | API errors are raised as typed exceptions with the error code and message |
| Rate limit handling | Automatic retry with backoff when rate limited |
| Pagination | Helper methods to iterate through paginated list endpoints |

## Community SDKs

Community-maintained SDKs are not officially supported but may be useful:
