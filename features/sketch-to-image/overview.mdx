description: "Draw freehand on a real-time AI canvas and see generated images update as you sketch, then send results to 3D generation."
---

Sketch to image is a fullscreen drawing canvas where your freehand sketches are converted into AI-generated images in real time. As you draw, the AI output updates continuously, giving you immediate visual feedback on your ideas.

## How it works

The interface is a split view.

- **Left side** -- A drawing canvas where you sketch with freehand tools.
- **Right side** -- The AI-generated image that updates in near real time as you draw.

The AI processes your sketch through fal.ai's real-time WebSocket API, producing a new image approximately every 128 milliseconds (~7.8 fps) when the connection is warm. The first generation after opening the canvas has a cold-start latency of about 3.3 seconds.

## Opening sketch to image

Click the **Sketch to image** button in the toolbar or use the command menu. The feature opens in fullscreen, replacing the canvas view temporarily. Your board is unaffected -- close sketch to image to return to the canvas.

## Drawing tools

The sketch canvas provides basic drawing tools.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Pen | Freehand drawing with adjustable brush size and color. |
| Eraser | Remove parts of your sketch. |
| Clear | Reset the canvas to blank. |

## Controls

### Prompt

Enter a text prompt in the prompt field to guide the AI interpretation of your sketch. For example, typing "a futuristic car" causes the AI to interpret your rough shapes as a vehicle. Without a prompt, the AI generates based on the sketch alone.

### Strength slider

The strength slider controls the balance between your sketch and the AI's creative interpretation.

| Strength | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Low (toward sketch) | The output closely follows the lines and shapes you drew. Less AI interpretation. |
| High (toward AI) | The AI takes more creative liberty. Your sketch serves as a loose guide. |

Adjust the slider while drawing to find the right balance for your needs.

## Using the output

Once you have an AI-generated image you like, you have two options.

### Save as image reference

Click **Save to canvas** to place the generated image on your board as an image reference. You can then use it as a mood board element or visual reference for your team.

### Send to 3D generation

Click **Generate 3D** to send the image directly to image-to-3D generation. This opens the generate menu with the image pre-loaded, letting you choose a model and create a 3D object from your sketch-derived image.

<Tip>
  The sketch-to-image-to-3D workflow is a fast way to go from a rough idea in your head to a 3D model on the canvas. Sketch your concept, let the AI refine it into an image, then generate a 3D model from that image.

## Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Frame rate | ~7.8 fps (128ms per frame) |
| Cold start latency | ~3.3 seconds |
| Warm latency | ~128 milliseconds |
| Connection | WebSocket to fal.ai |

Performance depends on network conditions and fal.ai server load. The WebSocket connection stays open for the duration of your sketch session to minimize latency.
