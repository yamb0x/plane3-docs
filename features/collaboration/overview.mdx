title: "Real-time collaboration"
description: "Work with your team simultaneously on the same board with live cursors, selections, and instant sync."

plane3 is built for teams working together on 3D content. Multiple users can open the same board and see each other's changes as they happen -- no saving, refreshing, or file merging required.

## How it works

Collaboration in plane3 is real-time by default. When you open a board that a teammate is already working on, you immediately see their cursor, selections, and any changes they make.

The collaboration system uses two synchronization paths:

- **Document state** -- Board structure, node graphs, annotations, and object properties sync through [Yjs](https://yjs.dev/) CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types). CRDTs ensure that concurrent edits from multiple users converge to the same state without conflicts.
- **Transform updates** -- Object position, rotation, and scale changes during drag operations sync through a fast last-writer-wins (LWW) path at 60fps. This keeps dragging responsive even with multiple collaborators.

Both paths run over a single WebSocket connection per user. There is no polling or manual sync.

## Presence system

The presence system shows you who else is on the board and what they are doing.

- **Cursor positions** -- Each user's cursor appears on the canvas with their name and a unique color. Cursors update at 60fps.
- **Selection highlighting** -- When a teammate selects an object, you see a colored outline matching their cursor color.
- **Active user list** -- The top bar shows avatars for all users currently on the board.

<Note>
  Presence data (cursors and selections) is ephemeral. It is not stored -- when a user leaves the board, their cursor and selection indicators disappear immediately.

## What syncs in real time

| Action | Sync behavior |
|--------|--------------|
| Add or delete objects | Appears/disappears for all users instantly |
| Move, rotate, scale objects | 60fps LWW sync during drag, CRDT commit on release |
| Generate a 3D model | Generation status and result visible to everyone |
| Add annotations (sticky notes, sketches) | Visible to all users as created |
| Edit node graph | Node and connection changes sync to all users |
| Cursor position | 60fps broadcast to all users |
| Cursor chat messages | Visible to all users in real time |

## Browser compatibility

Real-time collaboration works in any modern browser that supports WebSocket and WebGL. This includes recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. No browser extensions or plugins are required.
