Text-to-3D lets you describe what you want in plain language and receive a 3D model on your canvas. Type a prompt, pick a model, and generate.

## How to generate from text

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the generate menu">
    Double-click anywhere on the canvas. The generate menu appears at that location.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Text to 3D">
    Click the **Text to 3D** tab in the generate menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your prompt">
    Type a description of the model you want. Be specific about shape, style, and important details. For example:

    ```
    a medieval wooden shield with iron rivets and a faded crest
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a model">
    Select an AI service from the dropdown. **Hunyuan3D v3** is the default and works well for most use cases.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Generate">
    Click **Generate** to start. A progress indicator appears on the canvas. Generation typically takes 60 to 90 seconds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View your result">
    The 3D model appears on the canvas at the location where you opened the menu. Click it to select it and see its properties in the right panel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing good prompts

The quality of your prompt directly affects the quality of the generated model. Here are some guidelines.

<Accordion title="Prompt tips">
  **Be specific about shape and form.** "A chair" gives the model less to work with than "a mid-century modern armchair with wooden legs and a curved backrest."

  **Mention materials and textures.** Include surface details like "brushed metal", "rough stone", or "glossy ceramic" to guide the texture generation.

  **Describe the style.** Terms like "low-poly", "photorealistic", "stylized", or "cartoon" help the model understand the visual direction.

  **Keep it focused.** Describe a single object rather than a scene. Text-to-3D works best for individual assets.

  **Avoid negations.** Instead of "a chair without armrests", describe what you want: "a simple dining chair with four legs and a flat seat."
</Accordion>

## Generation history in the node graph

Every text-to-3D generation automatically creates a node graph for the resulting object. The graph contains:

- A **Prompt** node holding your text description
- A **generation node** (such as Hunyuan3D Text) with the model configuration
- An **Output** node representing the final 3D asset

You can switch to the graph view to see this pipeline, change the prompt text, swap the generation model, or add downstream operations like retexturing. When you re-run the pipeline, the asset updates in place on the canvas.

## Available models

| Model | Typical duration | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Hunyuan3D v3 | 60-90 seconds | Default. Good balance of quality and speed. |

<Note>
  Text-to-3D currently uses Hunyuan3D v3 as the only available model. Additional text-to-3D services may be added in future updates.
