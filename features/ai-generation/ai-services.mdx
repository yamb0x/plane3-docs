plane3 integrates multiple AI services for 3D generation and processing. This page lists every available service along with local operations that run directly in your browser.

## Service overview

<AiServicesTable />

## Generation services

### Text-to-3D

**Hunyuan3D v3** generates a 3D model from a text description. It produces textured meshes with reasonable geometry in 60 to 90 seconds. This is the default and only text-to-3D model currently available.

### Image-to-3D

Five models are available for generating 3D models from reference images.

- **Hunyuan3D v3** -- General-purpose image-to-3D with good texture quality. 60-90 seconds.
- **Trellis** -- Produces detailed geometry at the cost of longer generation time. 2-3 minutes.
- **TripoSR** -- The fastest option at around 30 seconds. Useful for quick previews before committing to a higher-quality model.
- **InstantMesh** -- Balanced single-image reconstruction. Around 60 seconds.
- **Seed3D** -- ByteDance's image-to-3D service. Performs well on organic shapes. Around 2 minutes.

## AI 3D operations

These services operate on existing 3D meshes rather than generating from scratch.

### Retexturing

**Meshy-5** generates new textures for an existing mesh. You provide a mesh and optionally a text prompt describing the desired appearance. The service replaces the existing texture while preserving the geometry. Typical duration is 3 to 5 minutes.

### Remeshing

**Meshy-5** regenerates the mesh topology of an existing model. This is useful when a generated model has messy geometry -- overlapping faces, non-manifold edges, or uneven triangle distribution. The output has cleaner topology while preserving the overall shape. Typical duration is 3 to 5 minutes.

### Mesh refinement

**UltraShape** refines mesh geometry using a reference image as guidance. You provide an existing mesh and an image showing the desired shape. The service adjusts the mesh vertices to better match the reference. Typical duration is 3 to 5 minutes.

### PBR estimation

**PBR Playground** estimates physically-based rendering material maps from a single image. Given a texture image, it produces albedo, normal, roughness, and metallic maps. These maps can be applied to a mesh for more realistic rendering. Typical duration is 30 to 60 seconds.

## Local WASM operations

These operations run locally in your browser using WebAssembly. They do not require a network connection and complete in seconds.

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Quad remesh | Converts a triangle mesh to a quad-dominant mesh with even topology. |
| UV unwrap | Generates UV coordinates for a mesh that lacks them. Required before applying textures. |
| Subdivide | Increases mesh resolution by subdividing each face. Useful before mesh refinement. |
| Smooth | Applies Laplacian smoothing to reduce surface noise and sharp edges. |

<Note>
  Local operations appear as nodes in the node graph and can be chained with AI services in the same pipeline. For example, you can subdivide a mesh, then refine it with UltraShape, then estimate PBR materials.
