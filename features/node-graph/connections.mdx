Connections (wires) link the output port of one node to the input port of another. They define how data flows through a pipeline. This page covers port types, compatibility rules, and special behaviors.

## Port types

Every port on a node has a type that determines what data it can carry.

| Type | Color | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| MESH | Blue | 3D mesh data including geometry, UV coordinates, and textures. |
| IMAGE | Green | 2D image data such as PNG or JPEG. |
| TEXT | Orange | A text string, typically a prompt or label. |
| NUMBER | Gray | A numeric value used for parameters like iteration counts or strengths. |
| BOOLEAN | Red | A true/false toggle for enabling or disabling features. |

Port colors are consistent throughout the graph editor, so you can quickly identify compatible connections by matching colors.

## Type compatibility

You can only connect an output port to an input port of the same type. Attempting to drag a wire between incompatible types shows a visual indicator and the connection is rejected.

| Output type | Compatible inputs |
|------------|-------------------|
| MESH | MESH |
| IMAGE | IMAGE |
| TEXT | TEXT |
| NUMBER | NUMBER |
| BOOLEAN | BOOLEAN |

There are no implicit type conversions. If you need to use an image as input to a node that expects a mesh, you must pass it through a generation node first.

## Single-input rule

Each input port accepts exactly one incoming connection. If you connect a second wire to an input that already has a connection, the previous connection is replaced.

Output ports have no such restriction. A single output can fan out to multiple downstream nodes. For example, one Load Image node can feed both a Hunyuan3D Image node and a UltraShape node simultaneously.

## Merge-on-connect

When you connect a node from one workflow to a node in a different workflow, the two workflows merge into a single graph. This happens automatically.

For example, if you have an image reference object and a separately generated 3D model, dragging a connection from the image's Load Image node to a UltraShape node on the 3D model merges both objects into one workflow. After the merge, changes to the image reference flow through to the mesh refinement step.

<Warning>
  Merging workflows is not reversible through undo of the connection. To separate them, you need to delete the connecting wire and any dependent nodes.
</Warning>

## Smart port matching

When you drag a wire from an output port and hover over a node (rather than a specific port), plane3 automatically highlights the best matching input port based on these priorities:

1. **Exact type match** -- Ports with the same type as the dragged output.
2. **Empty ports first** -- Among matching ports, unconnected inputs take priority.
3. **Top-to-bottom order** -- If multiple ports match equally, the topmost port is selected.

This lets you connect nodes quickly without needing to aim precisely at small port targets.

## Cycle detection

The node graph does not allow circular dependencies. If connecting two nodes would create a cycle (where data flows in a loop back to a node that already ran), the connection is rejected with a visual warning.

This ensures that every pipeline has a clear execution order: data flows from source nodes (Prompt, Load Image, Original Model) through processing nodes to Output nodes, with no loops.

## Creating connections

To create a connection:

1. Click and hold on an output port (right side of a node).
2. Drag the wire to an input port (left side of another node).
3. Release to complete the connection.

To delete a connection, click on the wire to select it and press **Delete** or **Backspace**.
