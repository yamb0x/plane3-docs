A pipeline is a connected chain of nodes that produces or transforms a 3D asset. You build pipelines by adding nodes, wiring them together, and running them. This page covers the full workflow from creation to iteration.

## Building a pipeline from scratch

<Steps>
  <Step title="Switch to graph view">
    Select an object on the canvas and click the **Graph View** toggle in the top bar, or create a new empty graph from the graph editor menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add nodes">
    Right-click on the graph canvas to open the node menu. Browse or search for the node you need and click to place it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect nodes">
    Drag from an output port on one node to an input port on another. Connections must match port types. See [Connections](/features/node-graph/connections) for details on type compatibility.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure parameters">
    Click a node to open its parameter panel on the right. Adjust settings like prompt text, iteration counts, or quality levels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect an Output node">
    Add an Output node and connect your final MESH output to it. The Output node determines what appears on the canvas.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Running a pipeline

Click the **Run** button on any node to execute it. When you run a node, all of its upstream dependencies execute first, in topological order. Nodes that are already materialized (previously run with the same parameters) are skipped.

Execution flows from source nodes to the target node.

```
Prompt → Hunyuan3D Text → Retexture → Output
  1           2              3          4
```

If you click Run on the Retexture node, plane3 executes Prompt, then Hunyuan3D Text, then Retexture -- in that order.

<Note>
  Running a pipeline does not re-execute materialized nodes unless their parameters have changed. This saves time when you only modify one step in a long pipeline.
</Note>

## Re-running with changes

To iterate on a pipeline:

1. Change a parameter on any node (edit the prompt, switch the model, adjust a setting).
2. The modified node and all downstream nodes reset to **draft** state.
3. Click **Run** on the Output node or any downstream node.
4. Only the changed node and its dependents re-execute. Upstream nodes that have not changed stay materialized.

The result updates in place on the canvas. You do not get a new object -- the existing one is replaced with the new output.

## Multi-branch workflows

A single workflow can contain multiple generation branches, each producing its own 3D object. This is useful when you want to:

- Compare different generation models side by side
- Create variations from the same prompt
- Build an asset that combines outputs from different services

Each branch needs its own Output node. The canvas displays one object per Output node.

```
                ┌→ Hunyuan3D Text → Output A
Prompt ─────────┤
                └→ TripoSR ──────→ Output B (via image path)
```

<Tip>
  Use multi-branch workflows to quickly compare generation quality across different models without creating separate objects.
</Tip>

## Example pipeline

Here is a typical pipeline for generating a textured, refined 3D model.

| Step | Node | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| 1 | Prompt | "a weathered stone pillar with moss" |
| 2 | Hunyuan3D Text | Generate initial 3D mesh from the prompt |
| 3 | Quad Remesh | Clean up mesh topology |
| 4 | Subdivide | Increase mesh resolution |
| 5 | Retexture | Apply new textures with a more detailed prompt |
| 6 | Output | Final result displayed on canvas |

Each step builds on the previous one. You can re-run any step to iterate without losing the rest of the pipeline.
