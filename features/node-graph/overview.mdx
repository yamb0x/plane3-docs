The node graph is a visual workflow editor that represents every operation performed on a 3D asset. Think of it as the recipe view -- it records how an object was made and lets you modify or replay that process.

## Canvas view vs graph view

plane3 has two views you can switch between at any time using the view toggle in the top bar.

Every action you take on the canvas -- generating a model, retexturing it, refining the mesh -- automatically builds a node graph in the background. You do not need to use the graph view to benefit from it, but switching to it gives you full control over the pipeline.

## Core concepts

### Nodes

A node is a single operation in the pipeline. Each node has typed input and output ports. Examples include a Prompt node (outputs text), a Hunyuan3D generation node (takes text or image input, outputs a mesh), and a Retexture node (takes a mesh, outputs a retextured mesh).

### Wires

Wires connect an output port on one node to an input port on another. They define the flow of data through the pipeline. Wires enforce type compatibility -- you cannot connect a text output to a mesh input.

### Groups

When you import a 3D file or generate an object, plane3 wraps it in a group container in the graph. The group holds the object's Original Model node and any downstream operations. Groups keep workflows organized when a board has many objects.

## Draft vs materialized lifecycle

Nodes in a pipeline have two states.

- **Draft** -- The node has been configured but not yet executed. Its output is empty or shows a preview placeholder. Draft nodes have a dashed border.
- **Materialized** -- The node has been executed and its output contains real data. Materialized nodes have a solid border.

When you click **Run** on a node, it and all its upstream dependencies execute in order. Once a node is materialized, changing its parameters resets it to draft state until you run it again.

## Automatic graph building

You do not need to manually create a graph before using it. Every board-level action that produces or modifies a 3D asset builds the corresponding graph automatically.

| Board action | Graph result |
|-------------|-------------|
| Text-to-3D generation | Prompt + Generation + Output nodes |
| Image-to-3D generation | Load Image + Generation + Output nodes |
| Retexture from context menu | Retexture node added downstream of existing pipeline |
| Import a 3D file | Original Model + Output nodes inside a group |

You can then switch to the graph view to see the full history, add new operations, or re-run with different parameters.
