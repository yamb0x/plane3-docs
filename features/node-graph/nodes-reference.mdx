description: "Complete reference of all node types in the plane3 node graph, organized by category."
---

The node graph includes node types across five categories. This page lists every node with its inputs, outputs, and a brief description.

## Core nodes

These nodes are the building blocks present in most pipelines.

| Node | Inputs | Outputs | Description |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Original Model | -- | MESH | The starting point for imported 3D files. Contains the raw mesh data as loaded. |
| Load Image | -- | IMAGE | Loads an image file for use as a reference. Can source from an uploaded file or a canvas image reference. |
| Prompt | -- | TEXT | Holds a text string used as input for generation nodes. You edit the text directly on the node. |
| Output | MESH | -- | Marks the final result of a pipeline branch. The mesh connected here is what appears on the canvas. |

## Text-to-3D nodes

| Node | Inputs | Outputs | Description |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Hunyuan3D Text | TEXT (prompt) | MESH | Generates a textured 3D mesh from a text description. 60-90 second generation time. |

## Image-to-3D nodes

| Node | Inputs | Outputs | Description |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Hunyuan3D Image | IMAGE (reference) | MESH | Generates a 3D mesh from a reference image using Hunyuan3D v3. 60-90 seconds. |
| Trellis | IMAGE (reference) | MESH | Image-to-3D with detailed geometry. 2-3 minutes. |
| TripoSR | IMAGE (reference) | MESH | Fast single-image 3D reconstruction. ~30 seconds. |
| InstantMesh | IMAGE (reference) | MESH | Single-image mesh generation with balanced quality and speed. ~60 seconds. |
| Seed3D | IMAGE (reference) | MESH | Image-to-3D generation by ByteDance. ~2 minutes. |

## AI 3D operation nodes

These nodes modify existing meshes using AI services.

| Node | Inputs | Outputs | Description |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Retexture | MESH, TEXT (optional prompt) | MESH | Generates new textures for an existing mesh using Meshy-5. 3-5 minutes. |
| Remesh | MESH | MESH | Regenerates mesh topology for cleaner geometry using Meshy-5. 3-5 minutes. |
| UltraShape | MESH, IMAGE (reference) | MESH | Refines mesh geometry guided by a reference image. 3-5 minutes. |
| PBR Estimate | IMAGE | IMAGE (albedo), IMAGE (normal), IMAGE (roughness), IMAGE (metallic) | Estimates PBR material maps from a single image using PBR Playground. 30-60 seconds. |

## Local operation nodes

These nodes run in your browser via WebAssembly. They execute in seconds with no network dependency.

| Node | Inputs | Outputs | Description |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Quad Remesh | MESH, NUMBER (target face count) | MESH | Converts triangle meshes to quad-dominant topology with configurable density. |
| UV Unwrap | MESH | MESH | Generates UV coordinates for meshes that lack them. Required before texturing operations. |
| Subdivide | MESH, NUMBER (iterations) | MESH | Increases mesh resolution by subdividing faces. Each iteration roughly quadruples the face count. |
| Smooth | MESH, NUMBER (iterations), NUMBER (factor) | MESH | Applies Laplacian smoothing to reduce noise. The factor parameter controls the smoothing strength. |

## Port types

Each input and output port has a type. For a complete explanation of port types and compatibility rules, see [Connections](/features/node-graph/connections).

| Type | Color | Data |
|------|-------|------|
| MESH | Blue | 3D mesh with geometry, UVs, and textures |
| IMAGE | Green | 2D image (PNG, JPEG) |
| TEXT | Orange | Text string |
| NUMBER | Gray | Numeric value |
| BOOLEAN | Red | True or false |
