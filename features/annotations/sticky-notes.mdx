Sticky notes let you add short text comments directly on the canvas. They are visible to all collaborators and sync in real time, making them ideal for feedback sessions, design reviews, and contextual callouts.

## Creating a sticky note

<Steps>
  <Step title="Activate the tool">
    Press `C` on your keyboard to activate the sticky note tool. Your cursor changes to indicate placement mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click to place">
    Click anywhere on the canvas to place a sticky note at that location. The note appears immediately with an editable text area.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Type your text">
    Start typing your comment. The text auto-scales to fit within the note. Press **Escape** or click outside the note to finish editing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Appearance

Each sticky note is a 175 by 175 pixel card with a slight random rotation, giving the canvas a natural, informal look. The note displays:

- **Text content** -- Your comment, auto-scaled to fit the card area.
- **Author name** -- The name of the user who created the note, shown at the bottom.
- **Timestamp** -- When the note was created, displayed next to the author name.

The random rotation is assigned when the note is created and stays fixed. Each note gets a slightly different angle, so a cluster of notes looks like physical sticky notes on a desk.

## Editing and moving

- **Edit text** -- Double-click a sticky note to re-enter editing mode. Change the text and click outside to save.
- **Reposition** -- Click and drag a sticky note to move it anywhere on the canvas.
- **Delete** -- Select a sticky note and press **Delete** or **Backspace** to remove it.

## Real-time sync

All sticky note actions sync to every collaborator on the board instantly.

| Action | Sync behavior |
|--------|--------------|
| Create | Appears for all users immediately |
| Edit text | Updates live as you type |
| Move | Position updates at 60fps during drag |
| Delete | Removed for all users immediately |

## Use cases

- **Design review** -- Place notes next to specific objects with feedback like "adjust proportions" or "approved."
- **Task tracking** -- Mark areas that need work with notes describing what to do.
- **Meeting notes** -- During a collaborative session, drop notes as discussion points come up.
- **Version commentary** -- Leave notes explaining why a particular design choice was made.

<Tip>
  Sticky notes are persistent and remain on the board until deleted. For ephemeral messages, use [cursor chat](/features/collaboration/cursor-chat) instead.
