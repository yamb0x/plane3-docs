Image references are images placed directly on the canvas as floating cards. Use them for mood boards, design direction, visual feedback, or as direct inputs to AI generation.

## Adding an image reference

You can add images to the canvas in two ways.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Drag and drop">
    Drag an image file (PNG, JPEG, or WebP) from your file manager onto the canvas. The image appears as a floating card at the drop location.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Right panel">
    Click the **Add image** option in the right panel. Browse your files and select an image. The image is placed at the center of your current viewport.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Working with image references

Once placed, image references behave like any other object on the canvas.

- **Move** -- Click and drag to reposition the image anywhere on the canvas.
- **Select** -- Click the image to select it and view its properties in the right panel.
- **Delete** -- Select the image and press **Delete** or **Backspace** to remove it.

Image references are flat cards that float above the ground plane. They do not have 3D geometry -- they are display-only on the canvas.

## Using images for AI generation

Image references can serve as inputs for image-to-3D generation. There are two ways to use them.

### From the canvas

1. Select the image reference on the canvas.
2. Double-click the canvas to open the generate menu.
3. The Image to 3D tab is pre-populated with the selected image.
4. Choose a model and click **Generate**.

### From the node graph

In the graph view, you can connect an image reference to AI generation nodes directly.

1. Switch to the graph view.
2. The image reference has a **Load Image** node.
3. Drag a wire from the Load Image output to the IMAGE input of any image-to-3D node (Hunyuan3D Image, Trellis, TripoSR, InstantMesh, or Seed3D).

When you drag a connection from an image reference to a node on a different object, the two workflows merge into one graph. The image reference becomes part of the generation pipeline.

<Tip>
  Place several reference images on your canvas as a mood board. When you find one that matches your vision, connect it directly to a generation node to create a 3D model from it.

## Real-time sync

Image references sync to all collaborators on the board.

| Action | Sync behavior |
|--------|--------------|

| Move | Position updates during drag |
| Delete | Removed for all users immediately |

## Supported image formats

| Format | Supported |
