title: "Path tracer"
description: "Render photorealistic images of your 3D scenes with the built-in progressive path tracer."
---

plane3 includes a built-in path tracer for rendering photorealistic images of your 3D models. It runs in the browser and produces progressive results -- the image refines over time as more light samples are calculated.

## Opening the path tracer

1. Select one or more objects on the canvas (or select none to render the full scene).
2. Click the **Render** button in the top bar, or right-click and select **Render**.
3. The path tracer opens in a modal with its own viewport and controls.

## How it works

The path tracer simulates light bouncing through the scene. It starts with a noisy image and progressively cleans it up as more samples accumulate. You can watch the image refine in real time.

Each quality preset controls how many samples are computed. Higher sample counts produce cleaner images but take longer.

## Quality presets

| Preset | Samples | Best for |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Preview | 32 | Quick checks. Noisy but fast. Results in seconds. |
| Medium | 128 | Good balance of quality and speed. Suitable for review. |
| High | 512 | Clean renders with minimal noise. Good for presentations. |
| Ultra | 2048 | Maximum quality. Use for final output images. |

## Lighting

### HDRI environments

The path tracer uses HDRI (High Dynamic Range Image) environment maps for lighting. Five presets are included:

- **Studio** -- Controlled studio lighting with soft shadows.
- **Outdoor** -- Natural daylight with blue sky.
- **Sunset** -- Warm directional light with long shadows.
- **Warehouse** -- Industrial interior with overhead lighting.
- **Night** -- Dark environment with subtle ambient light.

You can toggle the HDRI between being used only for lighting or also visible as the background. See [render settings](/features/rendering/render-settings) for all environment controls.

### Sun light

A directional sun light supplements the HDRI environment. You can adjust its azimuth, elevation, color, intensity, and shadow softness from the settings panel.

## Camera controls

The path tracer has its own camera separate from the canvas viewport.

- **Orbit** -- Click and drag to rotate the camera around the subject.
- **Pan** -- Middle-click or Shift+drag to move the camera laterally.
- **Zoom** -- Scroll to move closer or farther from the subject.
- **Focal length** -- Adjust from 14mm (wide angle) to 200mm (telephoto).
- **Depth of field** -- Enable DOF and adjust the f-stop to control background blur. Lower f-stop values produce more blur.

## Clay mode

Toggle **Clay mode** to render all objects with a uniform matte material, removing textures and colors. This is useful for evaluating form, shape, and composition without the distraction of surface detail.

## Exporting renders

Click **Export as PNG** to save the current render to your computer. The exported image matches the resolution of the render viewport. For higher resolution, resize the render modal before exporting.
